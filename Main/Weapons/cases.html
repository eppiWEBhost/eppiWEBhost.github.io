                    This weapon is the weapon used by the <i>Mushroom</i> class characters!
                    The major role for these weapons is to provide additional supporting ability
                    to the case through the struggles and adventures of the travelling party.
                    It may be worth noting that <i>Cases</i> deal a base <b>2</b> ticks of damage over time.
                    The same also applies to it's healing over time.
                    <br>
                    Each weapon can have a certain amount of properties that enhance its abilities.
                    Certain properties are unique to certain weapon types. Collect enough experience to gain
                    additional attributes for your weapons!
