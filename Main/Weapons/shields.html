                    This weapon is used by the players of the <i>Penguin</i> class. Its major role is 
                    to deflect and defend from oncoming attacks, dealing low damage; however, this damage 
                    may be much higher depending on the shield used! This character is able to provide 
                    buffs for other party members. It swings at a rate of <b>1 swing</b> per second. The 
                    <b>Block/Parry</b> features enter a cooldown of base <b>4 seconds</b> if no attack is 
                    received, and a base <b>1 second</b> if it manages to catch an attack.
                    <br>
                    Each weapon can have a certain amount of properties that enhance its abilities.
                    Certain properties are unique to certain weapon types. Collect enough experience to gain
                    additional properties for your weapons!
                    <br>
                    How to use: Tap in a direction to swing. Tap and Hold to enter shield state. Release to exit.
